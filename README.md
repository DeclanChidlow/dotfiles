A collection of configuration files that I use for various programs, applications and websites. These configs are created to fit my use case and are uploaded here for others to reference or use. Most of these configs are cut down and contain only the very bare basics.

They are primarily visually themed around [Srcery](srcery-colors.github.io/).
