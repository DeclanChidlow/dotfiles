A collection of configuration files that I use for various programs, applications, and tools. These configs are created to fit my use case and are uploaded here for others to reference and use. Most of these configs are minimal and contain only features as I need them.

## Devices

Each one of my devices is named after an old computing or 'hacker' term. Usually from an old film.

### Baud

Baud is the hostname of my laptop, which is currently a Framework Laptop 13. I'm a big fan of the device and [have written a review containing my opinions of it](https://vale.rocks/blog/A_Year_With_The_Framework_Laptop_13). Currently it runs NixOS.

### Mainframe

Mainframe is the hostname of my home server. The poor machine is a Frankenstein's monster of parts, and you can read about its specs and the software it runs on [the services page of my website](https://vale.rocks/services). It is begging for death.

### Phreak

Phreak is the hostname of my phone, currently a Pixel 7a. It runs Android and therefore there aren't many configs to share.
